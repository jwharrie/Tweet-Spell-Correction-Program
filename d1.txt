1272699791873630208	@AimiHamraie @lilririah Purdue's is very purposefully vague. There will be "disciplinary action" for not following protocols, although no specifics have been released on what that will be. I think cops will be responsible for breaking up large gatherings on campus, but that hasn't been explicitly stated
